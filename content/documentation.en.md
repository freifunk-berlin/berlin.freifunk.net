Freifunk's foundation is a so called mesh network. All routers within the Freifunk network can communicate with one another and form their own wifi network. A routing protocol allows for everybody within the Freifunk network to communicate and exchange data with other participants. Some of the nodes within the network are further connected with the Internet. That way, everyone within Freifunk has also a direct access to the global network.

The [Freifunk-Wiki](https://wiki.freifunk.net/) is a central source of information for Freifunkers, in which everyone is warmly invited to participate. Freifunk Berlin is also there.

Here are a few good starting points:

- [wiki.freifunk.net](https://wiki.freifunk.net/), the general main page of the Freifunk Wiki.
- [wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin), the Berlin page in the wiki.
- [wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:Firmware](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:Firmware), further information on the Berlin Freifunk firmware including frequently asked questions.
- [wiki.freifunk.net/MABB](https://wiki.freifunk.net/MABB), the site for the support of Berlin Freifunk by the Berlin-Brandenburg media authority.
