## Everybody can participate!

Talk to your friends, business partners and everyone who surrounds you and spread the idea of Freifunk. Everyone can become a Freifunker! We look forward to your support

* expanding the Freifunk network by setting up new Freifunk routers ([see below](#would-you-like-to-set-up-a-freifunk-router)) or by providing interesting locations for Freifunk routers (e.g. rooftops).
* the development of information material, banners, stickers, t-shirts... whatever creative thing you can think of!
* disseminating the idea at events, bar camps and congresses.
* operating services for the community and developing web applications.

[Get in touch]({{< relref path="contact.md" >}}) and come to the Freifunk meeting or sign up for the mailing list. You can also support us with [Donations]({{< relref path="donate.md" >}}).

## Would you like to set up a Freifunk router?

### Starter kit

_Apartment, shop, cafe, restaurant, bar..._

{{< img src="participate_small.png" alt="Person at the laptop with a router on the windowsill" >}}

You want to

* connect to the Freifunk network in your neighborhood.
* share your internet connection.
* Set up the first Freifunk router in your area.

Here's how you can join in

* When deciding which router you should get for Freifunk, see the article [Berlin:Firmware](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:Firmware#Unterst.C3.BCtzte_Router) of the [Wiki]({{< relref path="wiki.md" >}}).
* Proceed as described in the article [Berlin:Firmware:HowTo](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:Firmware/HowTo) to flash and configure the firmware.
* Place the router in a suitable location (e.g. windowsill).

### Level 2

_Balcony, tall building, public square, park, extensive grounds..._

{{< img src="participate_medium.png" alt="Happy people with WiFi reception on cell phones and laptops" >}}

You want to

* expand the Freifunk network to a larger area. Higher locations (e.g. balconies or roofs) on 2.4 GHz are particularly suitable for this.
* establish a connection to a Freifunk router that is further away (up to ~5km). For stable connections, a clear view of the remote router and the 5 GHz band are required.

Here's how you can join in

* Get a Freifunk-enabled outdoor router. Recommendations can be found in the article [Berlin:Firmware](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:Firmware#Unterst.C3.BCtzte_Router) of the [Wiki]({{< relref path="wiki.md" >}} ).
* You may be able to borrow this hardware as part of a [letter of transfer](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:%C3%9Cberlassenserkl%C3%A4rung).
* To plan the new connections, you should [contact]({{< relref path="contact.md" >}}) the Freifunk operators who operate the remote routers.

### Backbone

_Roof, attic, tall building, public building, town hall, church tower..._

{{< img src="participate_big.png" alt="Roofs of houses connected with red dots and lines to symbolize the mesh network" >}}

You want to

* Strengthen the “backbone” of the Freifunk network by establishing stable radio connections to distant Freifunk routers (up to ~10km). A clear view of the remote router is required for stable connections.

Here's how you can join in

* Get several Freifunk-enabled outdoor routers for 5 GHz. Recommendations can be found in the article [Berlin:Firmware](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:Firmware#Unterst.C3.BCtzte_Hardware) of the [Wiki]({{< relref path="wiki.md" >}} ).
* You may be able to borrow this hardware as part of a [letter of transfer](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:%C3%9Cberlassenserkl%C3%A4rung).
* To plan the new connections, you should [contact]({{< relref path="contact.md" >}}) the Freifunk operators who operate the remote routers.
