We rely on regular donations to set up and maintain our free radio network. We prefer donations via [betterplace.org](https://www.betterplace.org/de/projects/83703). This is easier for us as well as for you. Donation receipts are issued by [betterplace.org](https://www.betterplace.org/de/projects/83703) and sent out in February of the following year.

Alternatively, a bank transfer is also possible. Please enter a reason for payment. We will only issue donation receipts for donations of EUR 20 or more if we have your postal address. Please enter this in the reason for payment or via spenden{at}foerderverein.freie-netwerke.de.
