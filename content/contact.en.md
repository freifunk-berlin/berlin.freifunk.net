## Meetings

Time and date of the meetings of the Berlin Freifunk community can be found in the [Berlin:Treffen](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:Treffen) article in the Freifunk Wiki. At these meetings you can learn everything you need for running Freifunk - from constructing antennas to configuring access points. If you want to participate, you will find interesting projects and the right people to kick off your own project! There are many opportunities for supporting Freifunk: as network engineer, programmer, author, designer or idea promoter...
