Here you can meet many other Freifunkers and make new contacts. We use this meeting to discuss community topics and have a good time over a delicious drink. The [c-base](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.51297&mlon=13.42011#map=17/52.51297/13.42011) is on the Spree, very close to Jannowitzbrücke station.

Would you like to suggest a topic that we should discuss as a community? Send your topic suggestion via the mailing list. Just drop by, we are always happy to meet new people.
