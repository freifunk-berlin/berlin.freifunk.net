## Statistics on our WLAN / WiFi nodes

For many of the Freifunk nodes we offer detailed statistics in our [Monitor](https://monitor.berlin.freifunk.net/cgp/) that give you an insight into the use and performance of the respective hotspot. For example, you can view the data transfer, check the ping times and find out how many devices are currently connected to the Freifunk network via this node. This information will help you find the best node near you and give you an idea of ​​how heavily a hotspot is used. All data is updated regularly so that you always get the latest information.
