The [Freifunk-Wiki](https://wiki.freifunk.net/) is a central source of information for Freifunkers, in which everyone is warmly invited to participate. Freifunk Berlin is also there.

Here are a few good starting points:

- [wiki.freifunk.net](https://wiki.freifunk.net/), the general main page of the Freifunk Wiki.
- [wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin), the Berlin page in the wiki.
- [wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:Firmware](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Berlin:Firmware), further information on the Berlin Freifunk firmware including frequently asked questions.
- [wiki.freifunk.net/MABB](https://wiki.freifunk.net/MABB), the site for the support of Berlin Freifunk by the Berlin-Brandenburg media authority.
